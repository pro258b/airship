the code now can
 1. Copy monitoring/config.example.json to your own config, fill in RPC endpoints, vault/executor addresses, and
  per-token pool metadata (router, fee/path).
  2. Point state_file at a writable location if you want baseline persistence, then run
  monitoring.service.load_service_from_file(...).run_forever() under asyncio.
