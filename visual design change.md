you can definitely add the button to index.html yourself! It's actually better for you to do it since you
  have direct control over the navigation structure and styling preferences.

  Here's how to add it:

  1. Find the navigation section in index.html - look for existing buttons/links
  2. Copy the pattern of existing navigation buttons
  3. Add your new button following the same HTML structure and CSS classes
  4. Set the href to point to your new file: href="strategy-calculator.html"

  Example pattern to follow:
  <a href="strategy-calculator.html" class="existing-button-class">Strategy Calculator</a>

  Benefits of you doing it:
  - Faster than asking me each time
  - You control the button text, placement, and styling
  - You can see the result immediately
  - You learn the navigation patterns

  When to ask me:
  - If the existing buttons use complex JavaScript for navigation
  - If you want me to also add corresponding JavaScript functionality
  - If you're unsure about the CSS classes or styling
  
JSON-Based Content Store (Simplest)
    - Create resources/balloons.json with pricing, specs, descriptions
    - Load dynamically via JavaScript fetch
    - Easy to edit without touching HTML structure
  2. Admin Interface Integration
    - Add "Edit Resources" section to existing airship interface
    - Use same styling/components as current calculator
    - Store changes in localStorage or backend database
  3. Template-Based Rendering (Following your pipeline philosophy)
    - Create balloon card templates in JavaScript
    - Use the same internationalization system already in place
    - Leverage existing script.js patterns
    
  choice

  1. Initialize a web-based game structure with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the Freedom Economics Engine
  2. Set up a more complex framework (React, Vue, etc.) for richer interactivity
  3. Create a simple calculator/simulator as the MVP for the lifestyle arbitrage concept
  4. Plan the full architecture first with an implementation plan
  
  
  -                  <div class="airship-icon" id="airshipIcon">üéà</div>
       13 +                  <div class="airship-icon" id="airshipIcon">
       14 +                      <img src="resources/airship.jpg" alt="Airship" />


HTML Changes:
  - Replaced the emoji balloon (üéà) with an <img> element pointing to resources/airship.jpg

  CSS Changes:
  - Updated .airship-icon styles to accommodate the image
  - Set image size to 60x60px with object-fit: contain
  - Added rounded borders for a polished look
  - Maintained hover scaling effect

  JavaScript Changes:
  - Modified updateAirshipProgression() to work with the image instead of changing emoji
  - Added color filters that change the airship's hue based on Bitcoin tier progression:
    - Solo Explorer (‚Çø0.1-1.0): Default color
    - Freedom Cruiser (‚Çø1.0-5.0): 60¬∞ hue shift
    - World Explorer (‚Çø5.0-10.0+): 120¬∞ hue shift + brightness boost

  Now your airship image will visually evolve as players accumulate more Bitcoin, changing colors to reflect
  their progression through the freedom tiers. The language switching between English and Chinese is also fully
   functional.
