# Airship Freedom: The Arbitrage Adventure Game

## 🎯 Core Game Loop
**"Build your airship fleet while mastering global financial arbitrage"**

### The Central Narrative
You're an **Airship Entrepreneur** building a freedom-based travel empire. Every decision impacts your journey from broke nomad to aerial empire builder.

## 🎮 Unified Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. **Journey Mode** (Main Game)
Replace fragmented calculators with **mission-based progression**:

**Current Situation → Decision → Immediate Consequence → Long-term Impact**

#### Example Journey:
```
MISSION: "Need $3000 for your first airship"
├── SCENARIO: "Your laptop breaks in Bangkok"
│   ├── Option A: Pay $800 cash (immediate fix, lose savings)
│   ├── Option B: Collateral loan with BTC (risk/reward)
│   └── Option C: Skip repair, work without laptop (income penalty)
│
├── IMMEDIATE: Money/time consequences
├── PROGRESSION: Affects next mission unlock
└── FLEET STATUS: Updates airship tier
```

### 2. **The Airship Progress Tree**
Transform the static tier system into **unlockable capabilities**:

```

### 3. **Decision Engine** (The Fun Part!)

#### Choice Consequences:
- **Financial**: BTC holdings, monthly burn rate, debt ratio
- **Social**: Friend reputation, Instagram followers, network effects

Decision Matrix:
