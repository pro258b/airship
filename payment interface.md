 Added stable handle slugs to every item so Stripe records map directly to UI entries (airship/shop.js:5).
  - Introduced DOM-driven registry discovery plus Stripe price hydration helpers that fetch, normalise, and stamp
  price tags (airship/shop.js:207-312), and wired them into rendering/buy flows (airship/shop.js:330-378).
  - Declared the registry location in markup for discovery (airship/shop.html:7) and seeded a writable price cache
  scaffold (airship/stripe-prices.json:1).
  - Delivered a standalone Stripe CLI utility with dry-run support to create prices and persist mappings
  incrementally (airship/scripts/stripe_price_manager.js:1-211).
  - Logged the completed engineering stage in the implementation plan (airship/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:55-59).

  Testing

  - node scripts/stripe_price_manager.js list

  Notes

  - No Python code touched; no decorators or other Pythonic constructs applied.
  - Populate actual Stripe price data by running node scripts/stripe_price_manager.js create â€¦ with real
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, then reload shop.html to confirm live price hydration.
