# Stage 2: The 6 Ways to Lose Your Bitcoin Holdings

## 🎯 Design Philosophy
Each Bitcoin loss scenario teaches real-world lessons while creating dramatic story moments. Players learn through consequence, not lecture.

## 💸 The 6 Bitcoin Loss Scenarios

### 1. **Liquidation Cascade** - "The Margin Call"
**Setup**: Player uses BTC as collateral, market crashes 30%
**Loss Trigger**: Refuse to add collateral when margin called
**Bitcoin Lost**: 50-80% of collateral holdings
**Story**: "Your $2000 BTC collateral is now worth $1400. The platform demands more collateral or they'll liquidate. You're in Portugal with only $300 cash..."

**Choices**:
- 🔥 **Panic sell other assets** → Save some BTC but destroy other investments
- 💀 **Accept liquidation** → Lose collateral BTC but keep remaining holdings
- 🎲 **Double down with more BTC** → Risk total wipeout or recovery

**Lesson**: Leverage amplifies both gains and losses

### 2. **Scam Exchange** - "The Rug Pull"
**Setup**: Player finds a "high-yield" Bitcoin lending platform offering 20% APY
**Loss Trigger**: Platform disappears overnight
**Bitcoin Lost**: All Bitcoin deposited on platform
**Story**: "You wake up in Bangkok to find CryptoYield.io is offline. Your 0.3 BTC earning '20% APY' is gone. The Telegram group is full of angry nomads who lost everything..."

**Choices**:
- 😡 **Rage quit crypto** → Sell remaining holdings, stick to cash
- 🕵️ **Join recovery effort** → Spend time/money trying to trace funds
- 📚 **Learn from mistake** → Research real vs fake platforms

**Lesson**: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is

### 3. **Panic Sell Cascade** - "The Fear Spiral"
**Setup**: Major news breaks (China ban, Elon tweet, etc.), market crashes 40%
**Loss Trigger**: Player panic sells at the bottom
**Bitcoin Lost**: Opportunity cost of selling low + missing recovery
**Story**: "Bitcoin drops from $50k to $30k overnight. Your $1500 worth is now $900. Other nomads in your hostel are panic selling. The news says 'Bitcoin is dead'..."

**Choices**:
- 💀 **Panic sell everything** → Lock in losses, miss recovery
- 🧘 **HODL and meditate** → Weather the storm, potential recovery
- 📈 **Buy the dip** → Risk more money, amplify outcome

**Lesson**: Emotional decisions often lead to buying high, selling low

---

### 4. **Lifestyle Inflation** - "The Success Trap"
**Setup**: Player has Bitcoin gains, starts spending lavishly
**Loss Trigger**: Gradually sell BTC to fund expensive lifestyle
**Bitcoin Lost**: Slow bleed, all holdings over 6 months
**Story**: "Your 0.5 BTC is now worth $35k! You upgrade to luxury Airbnbs, eat at fancy restaurants, buy a new MacBook Pro. Each expense seems small, but the BTC keeps shrinking..."

**Choices**:
- 🛑 **Create spending rules** → Set limits on BTC spending
- 🎉 **YOLO lifestyle** → Spend it all, live for today
- ⚖️ **Balanced approach** → Spend some gains, keep some BTC

**Lesson**: Lifestyle inflation can destroy wealth faster than market crashes

---

### 5. **Wallet Disaster** - "The Lost Keys"
**Setup**: Player stores BTC in self-custody wallet
**Loss Trigger**: Multiple security failures compound
**Bitcoin Lost**: All BTC in affected wallet
**Story**: "Your laptop crashes in a Guatemala thunderstorm. You realize your wallet backup phrase is in your email... which you can't access without your laptop. Your 0.4 BTC is trapped forever..."

**Choices**:
- 🔧 **Expensive recovery attempt** → Pay $1000+ to data recovery experts
- 😭 **Accept the loss** → Consider it an expensive lesson
- 🎲 **Try sketchy recovery service** → Risk scams or partial recovery

**Lesson**: Self-custody requires proper backup and security practices

---

### 6. **Family Emergency** - "The Forced Sale"
**Setup**: Major family crisis requires immediate large sum
**Loss Trigger**: No choice but to sell BTC at bad time/price
**Bitcoin Lost**: Forced to sell during market low
**Story**: "Your sister calls from home: medical emergency, need $5000 immediately. Your BTC is worth $4200 right now (down from $6000 last month). Credit cards are maxed, no other assets liquid..."

**Choices**:
- ❤️ **Sell BTC immediately** → Help family, accept timing loss
- ⏳ **Try to find alternatives** → Risk delay while seeking other funding
- 💔 **Refuse to help** → Keep BTC but damage family relationships

**Lesson**: Emergency funds matter; Bitcoin shouldn't be your only savings
